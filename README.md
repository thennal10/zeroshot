# Zero-shot and few-shot TTS using YourTTS

Quoting the YourTTS paper:
> YourTTS brings the power of a multilingual approach to the task of zero-shot multi-speaker TTS... Additionally, 
our approach achieves promising results in a target language with a single-speaker dataset, opening possibilities 
for zero-shot multi-speaker TTS and zero-shot voice conversion systems in low-resource languages. 

Our aim is to leverage the code and techniques provided to make an easy-to-use finetuning and zero-shot voice cloning pipeline.
